As an integrated designer, proximity to our customers is particularly important to him: for him, the design process means accompanying people on the way to a sustainable solution. In the end, the result ensures a high level of satisfaction and enthusiasm. As a workshop leader or lecturer, Ben ensures clarity after brainstorming sessions and can quickly recognise connections. His mix of pragmatism, creativity and empathy makes him a master of human-centred design.",
